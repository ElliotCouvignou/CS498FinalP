NOTE: the master branch should always be stable and only has features once they are finished.
This is the branch we should demo with.

** request to become a contributor before you are allowed to push changes **


How to use github/Unity:

* please follow these steps as they are in place to reduce any github conflicts. You will be shamed for breaking rules *

SETUP:
1. clone repo.
2. Make a new branch for the feature you want (git checkout -b <new branch name> <reference branch>)
3. DO NOT WORK ON MASTER
4. DO NOT WORK ON MASTER
5. Make pull requests via browser (a lot easier) and add us to reviewers if you want to push your feature to master.

PUSHING:

* SAVE AND CLOSE YOUR UNITY EDITOR BEFORE GIT ADD * - files exist only while the editor is open, these are 'junk' files to us

* If you only made scripts, then only add them, BE CAREFUL WHEN USING "git add -A", this usually leads to merging conflicts later on *
